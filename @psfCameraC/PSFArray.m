function PSF = PSFArray(obj,pointSources)
% Create the pointspread functions (PSF) at field heights and depths
%
%   PSF = psfCamera.PSFArray(pointSources)
%
%  WORK REMAINS TO BE DONE HERE
%
% The point sources define a set of depths and field heights where we will
% calculate the point spread function.
%
% The psf camera is initiated with a relatively large and low resolution
% film.  This routine figures out where the each of the points will be
% imaged on the film, and then makes a higher resolution image of the point
% spread at that field height.
%
% The UNITS ARE NOT PROPERLY CALIBRATED HERE YET.  IT SHOULD BE THAT THE
% PSF SAMPLE POINTS ARE RETURNED WITH REAL UNITS, SAY EVERY XX MM.
%
% A point spread function is an image matrix over (x,y).  They are
% indexed by field height, depth, and wavelength.  So, the point spread
% function for wavelength, depth, and field height is
%
%   PSF(:,:,ww,dd,ff)
%
% Inputs:
%   obj:  psfCamera
%   pointSources:  These define the field heights and depths of the PSFs
%
% The array of PSFs can be applied in the slow forward calculation.  See
% p_renderOiMatlabToolFull.m, for an example.
