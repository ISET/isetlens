function dist0 = autofocus(obj, wave0, waveUnit,varargin)
% Set the camera film to the focus plane for the point and wavelength
%
%   psfCameraC.autofocus(wave0, waveUnit, [n_ob], [n_im])
%
% Description:
%   The input is a psfCameraC (obj) that has a point source, lens, and
%   film. The routine finds the position of the lens that brings that point
%   into best focus.
%
% Inputs
%   wave0
%   waveUnit = 'nm' or 'mm' or 'index'
%   n_ob  (default = 1)  Index of refraction of the object space
%   n_im  (default = 1)  Index of refraction of the image space
%
% The geometry is like this:
%
%    n_ob > BBM(lenses aperture lenses) -> n_im -> film
%
% The index of refraction (n) attached to the multiple surfaces that make
% up a lens. The index of refraction at each surface refers to the medium
% on the side closest to the film/sensor. You start with n_obj, and when
% you arrive at each surface you are informed by the index on the other
% side of the surface as the ray moves towards the film.
%
% OUTPUT
%   new film depth (distance from posterior exit plane).
%
%Examples
%   1:    psfCamera.autofocus(555, 'nm')
%   2:    psfCamera.autofocus(0.555, 'mm')
%   3:    psfCamera.autofocus(2, 'index') second value in the vector
