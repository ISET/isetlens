function obj = rtRealisticThroughLens(obj, rays, nLines)
% Rays at the entrance aperture are traced to the exit aperture
%
%  lens.rtRealisticThroughLens(rays,nLines)
%
% obj:  lens structure
% ray:  Ray structure
% nLines specifies rendering options
%     This can be a structure with the fields
%       .spacing ('uniform' or 'random')
%       .numLines (how many lines)
%     This can be a number
%       <= 0 means don't draw the lines; any other positive
%     number describes how many to draw.
%
% The initial rays are generated by a call to lens.rtSourceToEntrance,
% which takes a point input and generates the ray positions and angles at
% the entrance aperture.  That calculation is done without using any
% wavelength information
%
% On return, the rays at the front aperture are changed to be the position
% and direction of the rays at the exit aperture.
%
% This should be handled, ultimately by a linear transform following our
% analysis of the lens ABCD matrices and lightfields.  There is bit of a
% nonlinearity, however, because there is an aperture in the middle of the
% multi-element lens.
%
% See also psfCameraC.estimatePSF
%
%   In that routine, one can ask that the lines be extended to
%   the film plane by setting a flag.  The flag adds a final
%   surface in the film plane to the surfaceArray
%
% TODO:  Simplify this code and add comments.
