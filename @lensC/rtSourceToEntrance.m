function rays = rtSourceToEntrance(obj, pointSource, jitterFlag, rtType, subSection)
% Calculate rays from a point to the aperture grid on the first lens surface
% (the lens furthest from the sensor).
%
% Syntax:
%  rays = rtSourceToEntrance(obj, pointSource, jitterFlag, rtType)
%
% Description:
%  THe rays are calculated, but not drawn.  Each ray as one wavelength
%  assigned, but there is no wavelength dependence in air, so there is no
%  need to have multiple indices of refraction or wavelength for this
%  calculation.
%
%  The rays will be "expanded" later to save on computations that handle
%  wavelength differences.
%
% Inputs:
%  obj:          A lens object
%  pointSource   A 3 vector
%  jitterFlag:   Jitter the ray positions?
%  rtType:       Ray trace type
%  subSection:   To speed things up ... more comment!
%  
% Outputs:
%  rays:  Rays at the first lens surface
%
% Define the difference between 'ideal'and 'realistic' calculations here.
%

%  lensC.rtThroughLens, rayC.recordOnFilm

%% PROGRAMMING NOTES
%
%  I don't think we are handling the case of multiple points.  That would
%  be a step forward.

%% Set up the aperture grid on the front surface

% For PSF calculations, we sample across the front aperture fully.
% But for drawing the rays in an image, we might want to only sample
% rays along the x-axis or y-axis.  These are the xFan and yFan
% conditions.  We would use the subSection parameter to define that
% type of sampling scheme.
aGrid = obj.apertureGrid('randJitter',jitterFlag, ...

% These are the end points of the ray in the aperture plane
ePoints = [aGrid.X(:),aGrid.Y(:),aGrid.Z(:)];

%% Directions from the point source to the end points in the aperture

nPts = size(ePoints,1);
rays.origin    = repmat(pointSource, [nPts, 1, 1] );
rays.direction = rayDirection(rays.origin,ePoints);
rays.distance  = zeros(nPts, 1);

%% Additional storage allocation

% AL thinks we should store the XY positions at the front aperture,
% middle aperture, and exit aperture.  The slots for this information
% are created and storage space is initialized here.

rays.aEntranceInt.XY = [aGrid.X(:), aGrid.Y(:)];
